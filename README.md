This is a calories tracker app I am  writing based on the previous todolist  
This basic version can do the following:  
-has a basic GUI  
-add new food (name of food, calories per servings, how many servings)  
-delete food entry(right click on item)  
-save and load to text file  
-save food recipe  
-calculate calories consumed
-edit food entry (added on v1.1)
  
Things I would like to add to the future version:  
 
-introduce calendar and viewable by date   
-add more keystrokes and buttons    
-add "new/edit/remove" buttons to listview for more streamlined interface  
-remove and avoid adding duplicates to food recipe  
-expand food recipe library  
-introduce workout items  
-introduce graphicalHistoricalTracker  
-add multiple switchable pages (food - workout - graphicalHistoricalTracker)  
-introduce micro and macro  
-fix and catch exceptions (there is one nullPointerException when there is no existing txt file created)
